The code in this project utilizes a vast dataset of millions of flights from the year 2008 to provide real-time flight information. By leveraging this historical data, the code compares today's date with the corresponding date in 2008 to display the flights to and from a specific airport that occurred on the same day thirteen years ago.

The project focuses on showcasing both arrivals and departures, providing users with up-to-date information on flights that are currently in progress. By considering the current time, the code determines which flights from the specified airport are active and displays their relevant details, such as the city, airline, flight number, scheduled time, gate, and status.

Furthermore, the code goes a step further by extending the visibility of each flight beyond its actual arrival or departure time. It continues to display the flight's details for an additional hour after the scheduled time. 

By combining a vast dataset, real-time comparisons, and extended visibility, the code offers a comprehensive flight board experience that allows users to explore historical flight data and stay updated on the status of arrivals and departures from thirteen years ago.

The framework for the project is in Project Itinerary. App.py and index.html house the scripts that broadcast to the webpage.
